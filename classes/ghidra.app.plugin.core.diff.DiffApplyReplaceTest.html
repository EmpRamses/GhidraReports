***** STARTING Test: DiffApplyReplaceTest - testLabelReplace *****   (AbstractGenericTest.java:114) 
10:47:22 INFO  Memory Differs: The memory addresses defined by the two programs are not the same.
 
Differences are highlighted for the addresses that are compatible between
the two programs for the types of program information being compared by this Diff.
 
Some addresses are only in program 1 : [[00000200, 000002ff] ]
 
Some addresses are only in program 2 : [[00000400, 000004ff] ]
 
Note: Some parts of the program are not handled by Diff (for example:
         Markup where only one program has that memory address,
         Registers that are not common to both programs' languages,
         Program Trees, Data Types that haven't been applied to memory, etc.)   (CreateDiffTask.java:156)
